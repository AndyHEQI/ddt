DDT (Data-Driven Tests) allows you to multiply one test case
by running it with different test data, and make it appear as
multiple test cases.


# WARNING

This repository has been rather unmaintained for a while now. The main reason
being that I don't use `ddt` myself, having switched to use the amazing
[py.test](https://docs.pytest.org/) with its great support for parameterized
tests and fixtures and many other goodies. I recommend you to switch to py.test 
if you haven't yet.

If you'd like to step up as a maintainer, apply [here](https://github.com/txels/ddt/issues/59).


# Installation


```pip install ddt```

See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you plan to contribute to `ddt`,
and [License](LICENSE.md) if you plan to use it.
